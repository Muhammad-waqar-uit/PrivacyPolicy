4. **Service Analysis**: We may use aggregated and anonymized data to analyze user behavior, improve our services, and enhance marketing and advertising efforts.

## Data Storage and Security

1. **Firebase**: User data, including email, phone number, address, car details, profile picture, and carpooling posts, is stored on Firebase, a secure cloud platform. Fare Buddy ensures commercially acceptable means of protecting this data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
